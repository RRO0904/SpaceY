# SpaceY
The capstone project focuses on analyzing the costs and reuse of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets. Since SpaceX has significantly reduced launch costs by reusing the rocket's first stage, the goal is to predict whether this stage will successfully land. This project combines data collection and exploration, the development of predictive models, and the creation of visual tools for decision-making in the aerospace industry, specifically for the fictional company Space Y, which competes with SpaceX.
